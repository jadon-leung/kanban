# kanban

Built a full-stack Kanban project management application featuring three workflow columns, priority-based task ordering, and assignee tracking, enabling teams to manage dozens of concurrent tasks with consistent real-time state updates. Designed a normalized PostgreSQL database schema using Drizzle ORM with three relational tables to support fully type-safe CRUD operations via Next.js Server Actions, reducing runtime data errors and improving development reliability. Containerized the entire stack with Docker and Docker Compose, streamlining local setup and deployment to just four commands for faster onboarding and reproducible environments.
